                CSUDC is a color sensitivity test as a 2021-2022 science fair project started in 2020 by Logan Devine.

            Here's how this will work: You will press the button labeled <button disabled>Start</button> and then you will be displayed a panel with a button labeled <button disabled>Begin</button>. Press that. Then the page will change in color. Press <button disabled>End</button> when you are SURE the color you are seeing is what is being tested. We test the colors Red, Green, and Blue. Then we will move to the next lab. At the end, the page will convert back to white and your results will be revealed. Then, you'll give me those results and you'll be done!
